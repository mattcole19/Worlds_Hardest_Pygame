# Worlds_Hardest_Pygame

This is my attempt a remaking a game similar to 'World's Hardest Game' with python

### Why Pygame?
First and foremost: I wanted to use Python in order to better my knowledge of the languaage.  Creating a game was the perfect way 
to gain more experience with OOP. 

Additionally, I have future plans to extend the game and ultimately have the goal of creating an AI bot that can beat the game.
